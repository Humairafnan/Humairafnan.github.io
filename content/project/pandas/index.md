This project is a mental health self-assessment tool designed to help individuals evaluate their emotional well-being by reflecting on common symptoms of mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and fatigue.

The survey includes questions about mood, sleep patterns, appetite changes, self-esteem, and physical restlessness, alongside an inquiry into the userâ€™s mental health history and contributing factors such as relationship issues, past trauma, or financial stress.

The goal is to encourage self-awareness, help users identify potential mental health concerns, and provide a starting point for professional support if needed.
